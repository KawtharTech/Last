    <h3>MY BIOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Kawthar, and I’m in my final year studying Medical Laboratory
      Science at the University of Ilorin. I’ve always been passionate about
      making a difference, whether it’s through healthcare, technology, or
      simply helping people around me. In addition to my studies, I’m learning
      Frontend Engineering at Altschool Africa, where I’m diving into the world
      of tech. It’s been such an exciting journey, and I’m loving how technology
      can be used to solve real-world problems, especially in areas like
      healthcare and poverty alleviation—two causes that are close to my heart.
      I’m also part of the welfare committee in my school, which gives me the
      chance to support and advocate for others. Outside of academics and
      responsibilities, I enjoy reading, exploring new ideas, and growing as a
      person. Ultimately, I want to combine my skills in healthcare and tech to
      create meaningful solutions that positively impact lives. For me, it’s all
      about leaving things better than I found them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>WHY I JOINED THE PROGRAM</h3>
    <p>
      I joined Altschool Africa because I wanted to challenge myself and explore
      a new path that aligns with my passion for problem-solving and innovation.
      While my background is in Medical Laboratory Science, I’ve always been
      intrigued by the limitless possibilities that technology offers. For me,
      Altschool represents an opportunity to gain practical, hands-on skills in
      Frontend Engineering while being part of a vibrant community of learners
      and mentors. It’s not just about learning to code—it’s about understanding
      how to create solutions that make life better for people. I believe that
      combining my knowledge of healthcare with the power of technology can open
      doors to innovative solutions, especially in areas like patient care,
      diagnostics, and even addressing broader societal challenges like poverty.
      Altschool is helping me build the skills and confidence I need to turn
      these ideas into reality

    <h3>MY GOALS FOR SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING</h3>
    <p>
      1. Master Frontend Engineering Skills: My primary goal is to gain a deep
      understanding of Frontend Engineering, from building responsive and
      user-friendly interfaces to mastering frameworks and tools that create
      seamless user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Build Real-World Projects: I want to apply what I’m learning to
      practical projects that solve real-world problems. This hands-on
      experience will not only solidify my skills but also prepare me for a
      professional career in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Blend Technology with Healthcare: One of my long-term aspirations is to
      bridge the gap between technology and healthcare. By learning engineering
      principles, I hope to create innovative solutions that improve
      diagnostics, patient care, and access to medical resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Develop Problem-Solving Skills: I aim to sharpen my critical thinking
      and problem-solving skills, equipping myself to tackle complex challenges
      with creativity and precision.
